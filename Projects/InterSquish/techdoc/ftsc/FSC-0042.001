         Information

            This FSC is being distributed to members of the FidoNet(r)
            community in order to solicit their reactions to the
            proposals contained in it.  While the issues discussed may
            not be directly relevant to the problems of FidoNet,  they
            may be interesting to implementers.  Distribution is
            unlimited.

         0.0) A QUICK INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF INTENT

         The request for a gateway between WWIVnet and FidoNet through
         a program called  NetSEX was sent in  to Randy Bush (1:105/6)
         approximately a  month ago. During that  time there have been
         many questions pertaining to NetSEX  that I feel are relevent
         to the proposed gateway between WWIVnet and FidoNet.

         The major questions that I feel needs to be dealt with are:

            Will it  be possible for  WWIV Technology Networks  to use
            the  NetSEX gateway,  and if  so: will  a seperate gateway
            agreement be necessary?

            Will  it  be  possibile  for  WWIV  BBSes  that are not in
            WWIVnet  or  WWIV  Technology  Networks  to  use NetSEX to
            interface their BBS with FidoNet?

         The  current gateway  proposal that  I have  sent in pertains
         only to WWIVnet and FidoNet. What  I would like to do is have
         that policy  be between FidoNet  and a "NetSEX-Project"  that
         will keep  a list of  who's using NetSEX,  what their FidoNet
         address is, what their  WWIV Technology Network addresses are
         (for the NetSEX node and BBS  node), and if they gateway to a
         WWIV Technology Network: which one.

         To support  my reasoning I  will discuss each  question a bit
         and explain my proposal.

         1.0) WILL IT BE POSSIBLE  FOR WWIV TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS TO USE
         THE  NetSEX  GATEWAY,  AND  IF  SO:  WILL  A SEPERATE GATEWAY
         AGREEMENT BE NECESSARY?

         There have been several proposed-alternatives to WWIVnet that
         be  WWIV  Technology  Networks.  Various  planners from these
         networks have asked whether or not  they would be able to use
         NetSEX  to   gateway  between  FidoNet   and  their  proposed
         networks, and if so what steps would need to be taken.

         These proposed networks would be using BBSLIST.NET (a list of
         all nodes in the network,  similar to FidoNet's NODELIST) and
         CONNECT.NET (a  listing of all nodes  in the BBSLIST.NET file
         and how they  connect to one another-- a  topology map) files
         that are  independent of WWIVnet.  They would be  using their
         own nodenumbering schemes (however still be restricted to the
         65k maximum).

         There were  various possible things  offered by these  people
         that would possily work, but in  the end my response has been
         that the current proposed  policy between WWIVnet and FidoNet
         is between  those two networks,  and if they  were to gateway
         between their non-WWIVnet WWIV Technology Networks they would
         need to approach the FTSC for an agreement.


         1.1) WILL THERE BE ANY  POSSIBILITIES FOR WWIV BBSes THAT ARE
         NOT IN WWIVnet  OR WWIV TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS TO  USE NetSEX TO
         INTERFACE THEIR BBS WITH FidoNet?

         There  are   several  WWIV  BBSes  that   are  interested  in
         connecting  with FidoNet  but are  not interested  in joining
         WWIVnet (which  is the only network  currently operating with
         WWIV Technology).  Of the several people  who have asked, all
         of them are  running FourDog but would like  to get the speed
         of NetSEX  and the correct placing  of Netmail into mailboxes
         as opposed to the method FourDog uses.

         It is possible to run NetSEX on a non-WWIVnet BBS by creating
         the  data files  for a  WWIV Technology  Network that contain
         their  NetSEX  node  and  their  "WWIVnet"  node.  They would
         essentially be  faking out the software  by running a network
         consisting of two nodes.

         This  question I  have  been  unable to  sufficiently answer.
         While this situation would  involve someone that only belongs
         to  FidoNet, it  would still  be using  software designed  to
         gateway and it would be gatewaying messages from FidoNet to a
         WWIV Technology Network that consisted of one node.


         2.0) MY PROPOSED AGREEMENT

         What I  would like to do  is provide all sides  with the best
         possible solution that will privide  all sides with that same
         solution. As  it stands now, the  proposed gateway is between
         FidoNet  and WWIVnet.  What I  would rather  see is  a policy
         between  FidoNet and  an entity  called "The  NetSEX Project"
         that  would  keep  track  of  where  NetSEX  is being used to
         interface and/or  gateway with FidoNet. To  be more specific,
         and entity that would do the following:

            a) keep  track of all WWIV-BBSes  running NetSEX simply to
               interface with FidoNet. These would be systems that are
               not in WWIVnet or any  other WWIV Technology Network. A
               listing of their FidoNet  address, node number used for
               the BBS,  and node number  used for the  NetSEX address
               would be kept.

            b) keep  track of all  WWIV-BBses running NetSEX  that are
               connected to  a WWIV Technology  Network. A listing  of
               their FidoNet address, the  name of the WWIV Technology
               Network they  belong to, what  address they use  in the
               WWIV Technology  Network, and the  address in the  WWIV
               Technology Network they are using for their NetSEX node
               would be kept.

            c) do monthly or bi-monthly  tests of all NetSEX nodes and
               create a conference (EchoMail for FidoNet, Sub for WWIV
               systems) to support and discuss NetSEX.

            d) have  a reserved range  in the WWIV  Technology Network
               for  NetSEX  (and/or  other  gateways)  nodes, and have
               someone in  that network serve as  a liason between the
               "NetSEX Project" and the WWIV Technology Network.
 
            e) upload all of the files  on one or more FidoNet systems
               where  the various  members of  the FTSC  who work with
               gateways can track down information they may need.

         Given   these  actions,   the  following   is  hoped   to  be
         accomplished:

            a)  permit  non-WWIV  Technology  Network  systems  to use
               NetSEX  while  being  covered  by  an agreement between
               FidoNet to do so.

            b) permit  non-WWIVnet yet still  WWIV Technology Networks
               to  use  NetSEX  while  being  covered  by an agreement
               between FidoNet and the "NetSEX Project" to do so.

            c) keep an  index of all systems using  NetSEX, and keep a
               listing of what WWIV Technology Networks are accessable
               through FidoNet.

            d)  offer   an  easy-access  place   for  people  to   get
               information  pertaining  to  NetSEX,  FidoNet, and WWIV
               Technology Networks.

         This proposed entity, the "NetSEX Project" would be an entity
         existing  off of  FidoNet. I  offer  to  do all  of the  data
         collection and  send the information to  the people who would
         like it (providing  it is of reasonable cost  phone the phone
         connections).

         There are many benefits, and no drawbacks that I can see.


         3.0) AN END NOTE

         I am expecting that  this will be approved, or  even if it is
         it will not be without some form of modification. It seems to
         me  that this  would be  the best  way to  handle the  NetSEX
         gateway  without  spending  a  great  deal  of time approving
         individual networks  that are based  around the same  network
         technology. This proposal was made  from the point of view of
         someone that are working from within FidoNet.
