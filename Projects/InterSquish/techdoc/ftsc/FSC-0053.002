     Purpose

     To explain and document the existing usage of the ^aFLAGS field used
     by many software packages, including FrontDoor, TosScan, and
     D'Bridge. And to inform software authors of its proper usage.


     Prologue

     One of the problems with the FTS-1 (stored) message format is its
     limitations in regards to message attributes. Several bits are used
     (reserved) by SEAdog, another by several packers and editors - even
     though most mailer authors don't support them, they remain. One
     reason would be backward compatibility with older software.

     Unfortunately, this presents a problem for software authors that
     would like to pass extended message attributes for use and handling
     by other software.

     Some software packages have been using an alternate method called
     "FLAGS" which is 7-bit ASCII placed behind <SOH>FLAGS somewhere near
     the beginning of a message. The various flags will now be described.


     Flags

     The FLAGS string should be placed somewhere near the beginning of
     the message text, and is preceeded by a <SOH> (^a) character. There
     is no need to support all or any of the below mentioned flags.

     If flags are stripped when a message passes through a system, all
     relevant and correct FTS-1 status bits should be updated to indicate
     the original contents of the FLAGS field.

     Notes

     Xmail is related to the ARCmail 0.60 standard as adopted by the FTSC.
     The exception is that any type of compression method may be used and
     the naming convention isn't necessarily limited to that of the
     ARCmail 0.60 standard.
