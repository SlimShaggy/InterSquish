    Information:

        The purpose of this FSC is to focus discussion on particular
        problems in Fidonet(r) and possible methods of solution.  No
        proposed solutions in this document are intended as
        standards for Fidonet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general
        consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to such
        problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards.
        Distribution is subject to the limitations listed below.

Modem Handling
--------------

The current nodelist doesn't provide enought information for really fancy
handling of modems and connections.  With the advent of line sharing between
modems/faxes certain additions to the nodelist flags are required.

I am currently writing a product which will handle and use the following codes

Y.... where .... can consist of the hardware protocols the modem understands
    A   300 V.21          > Usually one of these flags would be present to
    B   300 Bell 103      > designate the chosen 300 baud hardware protocol
    C  1200 V.22 or Bell 212A
    D  2400 V.22bis
    E  9600 V.29
    F  9600 V.32
    G  9600 V.32 non-trellis coded

    Z   Do reverse carrier processing when dialing this node
    

I am in the process of designing a very sophisticated modem dialing language
and would like to propose the following additions to the node list
to help facilitate better modem/line handling with the advent of
different modem standards etc.
