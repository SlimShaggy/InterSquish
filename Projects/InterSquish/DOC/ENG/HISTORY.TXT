InterSquish NNTP Server

22.10.1999  Version 1.3.3
           -New parameter: TwitIPAddr, using wildcards allowed.
            The remote systems which IP addresses match the wildcards will 
            be denied.
            Changes in TwitIPAddr are applied immediately.  No service
            restart is necessary.
            -The removal procedure for the messages handed out with POP3
            has been changed: if the POP3TrashFolder is commented out, the 
            *.msg files will be completely removed.  Also it should now
            work OK under Win9X.
            -When run under Win9x InterSquish wouldn't let Windows shutdown.
            Finally fixed.
            -Users.cfg, Areas.cfg are re-read on-fly when need arises.
            -If the JAM messagebase described in areas.cfg is absent, an empty
            one is created..

27.09.1999  Version 1.3.2
            -All the commands are now not case sensitive.
            -Some fixes for log file processing.
            -Attack protection feature added - using the parameters
                SMTPNumSameConnections,
                NNTPNumSameConnections,
                POP3NumSameConnections
            you can indicate the allowed number of simultaneous sessions with
            one IP address. 
            -Using the ForceINTL parameter in IS.CFG, makes IS insert the INTL
            kluge into netmail messages.
            -No more traps after executing the NNTP "QUIT" command.
           

02.09.1999  Version 1.3.1
            -Trap doesn't occur when trying to select an area, which does
            not have a flag ('-$' or '-j') in areas.cfg. Now such areas
            are ignored, and the action is logged.
            
31.08.1999  Version 1.3.0
            -JAM support added. use the '-j' flag instead of '-$' to indicate
            "JAM".
            -Address parsing code changed. Addresses of the following form:
            "account@host (User Name)" are now parsed more correctly.
            -Messagebase working code changed.
            -Messagebase are now opened in "DenyNone" mode (was "DenyWrite").
            Seemengly, most of the hang-ups disappeared.
            -The infinite loop when opening a messagebase bug fixed. The
            ThreadTimeOut parameter was not parsed.
            -The exceptions log is in the working directory.  It's called
            "is_debug.log"
            -"SquishCfg" changed to "AreasCfg". "SquishCfg" is still correctly
            parsed for compatibility reasons.
            -The 'NEWGROUPS' NNTP command is now interpreted differntly: a 
            blank list is sent.  (In earlier versions it would send ALL
            groups).  I hope to make it work according to RFC some time.

19.08.1999  Version 1.2.4
            -New parameter - "DefaultInternetGate". See cfg file for details.
            -Messages, addressed to an Internet e-mail are now sent to the
            address indicated in "DefaultInternetGate".
            -Fixed bug in SMTP server, it would appear when a user would send
            a message to several addressees.
            -Instead of group list in DefaultGroups and DefaultROGroups
            you can now use '*' (asterisk), meaning "all groups"
            

17.08.1999  Version 1.2.3
            -Mail can be routed in both directions. Messages are selected
            according to users.cfg records.  If an address, indicated in
            users.cfg, is identical to tha of the gate, then all the
            netmail messages whose "ToName:" field equals to the account
            name will be selected.  Otherwise messages will be selected
            according to FTN addresses.
            -The "Subj" and "From" are now transferred to the client as
            quoted printable by default, if someone needs PlainText,
            uncomment PlainTextInHeaders in the cfg file.
            -Another attempt to fix the month name bug when posting a
            *.pkt.  Hopefully, this time it's successful.
            -Fixed bug with a thread being trapped when an invalid date is 
            encountered in the messagebase (the attempt to fix the bug in
            version 1.02 failed).
            -The remote host name is no longer resolved and logged -
            it could take a long (10-20 sec.) time when a new connection had
            to be established.
            -Addresses used in the mail and newsreader are now put into
            the "From" field (in previous version the gate address or the
            address indicated in Users.cfg would be used).
            The addresses should look like: "Ivan_Uskov@p0.f114.n5055.z2.fidonet.org",
            if it is not so, the gate address is used.
            -Fixed bugs when converting MSGID->MessageID (could be noticed in
            Internet addresses).
            -Some cosmetic fixes.

13.08.1999  Version 1.2.2
            -SMTP server wouldn't create the flag when posting. Fixed.
            -When using NNTPTryFoundTo, wrong encoding was used for
            Russian names (1251 instead of 866). Fixed.

10.08.1999  Version 1.2.1
            -You can now send netmail (SMTP->FTN), it works in
            unregistered versions as well.  Fetching mail (FTN->POP3),
            most likely, will be implemented in the next version.
            -Some parameter names in the cfg file have changed! Instead of
            LogFileName use NNTPLogFileName and SMTPLogFileName, the same
            applies to LogLevel (use NNTPLogLevel and SMTPLogLevel).
            -WindowsNT service name has also changed. I recommend running
            "IS -uninstall" for the previous version of the program if it
            was used as a service.
            -If you run the server with the "-Win95" parameter, you get a
            "face", which is hidden in the system tray :)
            -An alternative to "X-Comment-To" implemented:
            When "NNTPTryFoundTo" is uncommented, InterSquish tries to
            find the original message we are replying to.  if the message
            is found, the sender's name is put into the "To" field.
            Otherwise "All" is used.
            -Fixed bugs with converting FTN addresses. It would use
            "p3.f101.n5055.z2.fidonet.org" or even
            "p3.f101.n5055.z2@fidonet.org" instead of
            "Ivan_Uskov@p3.f101.n5055.z2.fidonet.org".
            -Fixed the PKT posting bug - the structure was not reinitialized
            and the "FromDate" and "To" field could be trashed.
            -Using only English month names for outgoing messages.
            
23.07.1999  Version 1.2.0
            -Posting is finally available :)
            -The program is now distributed as shareware.
            -New cfg file parameters to support posting.
            -Remote host's IP address is now logged.
            -Fixed the old bug when the headers of manually deleted messages
            would still be sent to the client.
            -Fixed address conversion bugs, which were not evident before.

23.05.1999  Version 1.1.1 
            -Text files used for configuration. ISSetup removed.
            -Now InterSquish supports user authorization.

            application) changed.
            -Code prepared for posting implementation.
            -InterSquish mailing list created.          

04.05.1999  Version 1.1.0
            -Using Borland C++ Builder 4.0 for compilation (not 3.0)
            -Windows NT service code improved. Hang-ups in the Control
            Panel eliminated.
            -You can now use command prompt for service (un)installation
            IS /install and IS /uninstall
            An empty window is no longer displayed.
            -To run under Win95 and Win98 use IS /Win9x
            -IS is now more conformant to applicable RFCs, Message-ID and
            References added, now you can use Netscape.
            -Version numbering policy changed.
            -Other fixes.
            
22.02.1999  Version 1.05
            -Fixed problems with cached threads - some thread objects
            wouldn't reinitialize correctly, which lead to a trap.
            -New parameter "ThreadCacheSize".

            -Added handlers for exceptions occurring when reading from a
            squish messagebase.
            -Server algorithm changed - upon disconnection a thread is not
            killed, it remains in the cache.
            -NEWGROUPS command from RFC 977 was not implemented. Fixed (it
            doesn't conform to the standard, though - all the groups are
            listed instead of only the new ones)
