    InterSquish Frequently Asked Questions

Q.1: Will it ever post?
A:   It already does. :) Contact me, register and off you go.

Q.2: Will JAM messagebase format be supported?
A:   It supports 'em. You forced me :)

Q.3: I installed InterSquish, everything seems to be OK, but a user cannot 
     get the newsgroups list. What's wrong?
A:   Most likely, groups are not indicated in squish.cfg. InterSquish does 
     publish the newsgroups, which are not assigned a group. You can do it
     like this:
     EchoArea IS.TEST f:\msg\echos\IS.TEST -$gA <другие ключи и адресаты>

Q.4: How do I register InterSquish?
A:   Contact me.

Q.5: Can I get the registered version for free?
A:   You can't get it absolutely for free. Currently you can get registered
     without paying anything, just do something useful for InterSquish,
     for example, that's how I got:
         -English documentation;
         -web-design for the InterSquish site;
         -place for the mirror.

Q.6: Where can I find InterSquish in the Internet?
A:  http://www.interdacom.ru/~citousers/ or just http://intersquish.da.ru,
    http://www.brs.ru/intersquish,
    ftp://212.19.67.58/pub/nftn

Q.7: What is the proper way to write the return address in OutlookExpress?
A:  I recommend doing it like this: ivan_uskov@p0.f114.n5055.z2.fidonet.org,
   It is possible to use your Internet address (ivus@geocities.com)
   but responses to your netmail messages will come via the gate..
