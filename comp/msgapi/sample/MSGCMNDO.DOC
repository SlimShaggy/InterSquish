                          The Message Commando
                          컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Usage:

        MSGCMNDO <config_file> <area_name>

<config_file> should be the name of the Message Commando configuration
file.  This is a flat text file, with one "nuke" name to a line.
MSGCMNDO will search and destroy any messages containing any of the
names you specify, anywhere in the message header or message body.

<area_name> is the path to the message area to scan.  By default,
MSGCMNDO will scan a *.MSG area, but if you add a "$" just before
the area's path, MSGCMNDO will also scan a Squish-format area.

Example:

    C:\MSGCMNDO> msgcmndo msgcmndo.cfg c:\msg\sysop249

        - Tells MSGCMNDO to scan for names listed in MSGCMNDO.CFG,
          nuking any matching messages in the SYSOP249 (*.MSG) area.

    C:\MSGCMNDO> msgcmndo altcmndo.cfg $e:\max\msg\sysop249

        - Tells MSGCMNDO to scan for names listed in ALTCMNDO.CFG,
          nuking any matching messages in the E:\MAX\MSG\SYSOP249
          (Squish) area.
