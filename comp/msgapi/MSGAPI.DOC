sword MsgOpenApi(struct _minf *minf);

        The MsgOpenApi function is used to initialize the MsgAPI. This
        function must be called before any of the other API functions
        are called, or else the results are undefined.  This function
        serves to initialize any needed structures, and to prepare the
        message bases for use.  This function's accepts one arguments:
        a pointer to a structure containing information about the
        application.  The contents of this structure as as follows:

                struct _minf
                {
                  word req_version;
                  word def_zone;
                  word _haveshare;
                };

        `req_version' indicates the MsgAPI revision level that the
        application is requesting.  The compile-time revision level
        can always be accessed using the constant `MSGAPI_VERSION'.

        `def_zone' should contain a default FidoNet zone number.  Certain
        message systems, such as the FTSC-0001 *.MSG format, do not
        store zone information with each message.  When the API encounters
        such a message and no zone is present, the specified zone will
        be used instead.  A `def_zone' of 0 indicates that nothing is
        to be inferred about the zone number of a message, and in that
        case, the API functions will return 0 as the zone number for
        any message with an unknown zone.

        `_haveshare' is automatically filled in by the internal API
        routines, and this flag indicates whether or not the DOS
        "SHARE.EXE" program is currently loaded.  Note that SHARE
        must always be loaded to access Squish-format bases
        in a multitasking or network environment.

        MsgOpenApi() returns a value of 0 if the initialization was
        performed successfully, and -1 if a problem was encountered.


sword MsgCloseApi(void);

        This function is used to denationalize the MsgAPI.  This function
        performs any clean-up actions which may be necessary, including
        the closing of files and releasing allocated memory.  This
        function should be called before the application terminates.

        MsgCloseApi returns a value of 0 if the API was successfully
        deinitialized, and -1 otherwise.

MSG * MsgOpenArea(byte *name, word mode, word type);

        This function is used to open or create a message area.  This
        function accepts three parameters:

        `name' is the name of the message area to open.  The contents
        of this string are implementation-defined.  (See `type' for
        more information.)

        `mode' is the mode with which the area should be opened.
        Values for `mode' are as follows:

                MSGAREA_NORMAL  - Open the message area in a normal
                                  access mode.  If the area does
                                  not exist, this function fails.

                MSGAREA_CRIFNEC - Open the message area in a normal
                                  access mode.  If the area does
                                  not exist, the MsgAPI attempts to
                                  create the area.  If the area cannot
                                  be created, this function fails.

                MSGAREA_CREATE   - Create the message area.  If
                                  the area already exists, it is
                                  truncated or started anew
                                  with no messages.  If the area
                                  cannot be created, this function
                                  fails.

        `type' specifies the type of message area to open.  `type'
        can have any of the following values:

                MSGTYPE_SDM     - Star Dot MSG (SDM).  This specifies
                                  a FTSC-0001 compatible access mode,
                                  and it instructs the MsgAPI to
                                  create and read Fido-compatible messages
                                  for this area.  If MSGTYPE_SDM is
                                  specified, `name' should contain
                                  the path to the *.MSG directory.

                MSGTYPE_SQUISH  - Squish (*.SQ?) format.  This
                                  specifies that the proprietary
                                  Squish message format is to be
                                  used for this area.  `name' should
                                  give the path and root name (eight
                                  characters) for the message area.

        In addition, if the mask `MSGTYPE_ECHO' is bitwise ORed with
        the `MSGTYPE_SDM' value, the area in question will be treated
        as a FidoNet-style echomail area.  This instructs the MsgAPI
        to keep high-water mark information in the 1.MSG file, and to
        stop the normal MsgAPI functions from writing to the first
        message in each area.  Other message formats have a cleaner
        way of storing the high-water mark, so this mask is only
        required for *.MSG areas.

        Other values for `type' are currently reserved.

        If this function succeeds in opening the message area, a
        handle is returned in the form of a pointer to a MSG
        structure.  This structure does not contain any information
        which can be used by the caller; all interaction should
        be performed through the MsgAPI functions only.

        If this function fails, NULL is returned, and the global
        `msgapierr' variable is set to one of the following values:

                MERR_NOMEM      - Not enough memory for requested task

                MERR_NOENT      - The area did not exist or could
                                  not be created.

                MERR_BADF       - The message area is structurally
                                  damaged.

sword MsgCloseArea(MSG *mh);

        This function serves to "close" a message area.  This function
        performs all clean-up actions necessary, such as closing
        files, changing directories, and so on.  The function accepts
        one argument, which must be a MSG* handle returned by the
        MsgOpenArea function.  The MsgCloseArea function should be
        called for each area opened by MsgOpenArea.

        If the area was successfully closed, MsgCloseArea returns
        0.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and msgapierr
        is set to one of the following:

                MERR_BADH       - An invalid handle was passed
                                  to the function.

                MERR_EOPEN      - Messages are still "open" in
                                  this area, so the area could
                                  not be closed.

MSGH * MsgOpenMsg(MSG *mh, word mode, dword msgn);

        This function "opens" a message for access, and it must be
        used to read from or write to a given message.  The function
        accepts three arguments:

        `mh' is a message area handle, as returned by the
        MsgOpenArea function.

        `mode' is an access flag, containing one of the following
        manifest constants:

                MOPEN_CREATE    - Create a new message.  This mode
                                  should only be used for creating
                                  new messages.

                MOPEN_READ      - Open an existing message for
                                  reading ONLY.

                MOPEN_WRITE     - Open an existing message for
                                  writing ONLY.

                MOPEN_RW        - Open an existing message for
                                  reading AND writing.

        `msgn' is the specified message number to open.  If mode is
        either MOPEN_READ, MOPEN_WRITE or MOPEN_RW, the message number
        must currently exist in the specified area.  If mode is set to
        MOPEN_CREATE, a value of 0 for `msgn' indicates that a new
        message should be created, and assigned a number one higher
        than the current highest message.  If `msgn' is non-zero,
        but MOPEN_CREATE is set to the number of a currently-existing
        message, the specified message will be truncated and the new
        message will take its place.

        For MOPEN_READ or MOPEN_RW, the following constants can also
        be passed in place of `msgn':

                MSGNUM_CUR  - Open the last message which was
                              accessed by MsgOpenMsg.

                MSGNUM_PREV - Open the message prior to the last
                              message accessed by MsgOpenMsg.

                MSGNUM_NEXT - Open the message after the last
                              message accessed by MsgOpenMsg.

        The MsgAPI maintains the number of last message message
        opened by MsgOpenMsg, which is used when processing
        these constants.  (See also MsgGetCurMsg.)

        If the message was successfully opened, the MsgOpenMsg
        function will return a pointer to a MSGH structure.  Otherwise,
        a value of NULL is returned, and msgapierr will be set to one
        of the following:

                MERR_NOENT
                MERR_NOMEM
                MERR_BADF
                MERR_BADA
                MERR_BADH

sword MsgCloseMsg(MSGH *msgh);

        The MsgCloseMsg function serves to "close" a message which has
        been previously opened by MsgOpenMsg.  All messages should
        be closed after use, or else data loss may result.

        This function accepts a single argument, which is the message
        handle that was returned by MsgOpenMsg.

        If the message was successfully closed, this function
        returns 0.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned, and
        msgapierr is set to:

                MERR_BADH

dword MsgReadMsg(MSGH *msgh, XMSG *msg, dword ofs, dword bytes,
                 byte *text, dword cbyt, byte *ctxt);

        The MsgReadMsg function is used to read a message
        from disk.  This function can be used to read all parts
        of a message, including the message header, message body,
        and control information.

        `msgh' is a message handle, as returned by the MsgOpenMsg
        function.  The message in question must have been
        opened with a mode of either MOPEN_READ or MOPEN_RW.

        `msg' is a pointer to an XMSG (extended message) structure.
        The format of this structure is detailed below, but it
        contains all of the message information that is found in the
        message header, including the to/from/subject fields,
        origination and arrival dates, 4D origination and destination
        addresses, and so forth.  (See the appendices for specific
        information on the XMSG structure itself.)  If the application
        wishes to read the header of a given message, this argument
        should point to an XMSG structure.  Otherwise, this argument
        should be NULL, which informs the API that the message header
        does not need to be read.

        `ofs' is used for reading message text in a multiple-pass
        environment.  This defines the offset in the message body
        from which the API should start reading.  To start reading
        from the beginning of the message, a value of 0L should
        be given.  Otherwise, the offset into the message (in bytes)
        should be given for this argument.  If the application
        does not wish to read the message body, this argument should
        be set to 0L.

        `bytes' represents the maximum number of bytes to read from
        the message.  Fewer bytes may be read, but the API will read
        no more than `bytes' during this call.  (See `text', and also
        this function's return value.)  If the application does
        not wish to read the message body, this argument should be
        set to 0L.

        `text' is a pointer to a block of memory, into which the
        API will place the message body.  The message body will be
        read from the position specified by `ofs', up to a maximum
        of `bytes' bytes.  If the application does not wish to
        read the message body, this argument should be set to NULL.

        `cbyt' represents the maximum number of bytes of control
        information to read from the message.

        `ctxt' is a pointer to a block of memory, into which the
        API will place the message control information.  No
        more than `cbyt' bytes of control information will be
        placed into the buffer.  NOTE: unlike the message text
        functions, control information can only be read in one
        pass.

        The text read by this function is free-form.  The message
        body may or may not contain control characters, NULs, or
        any other sequence of characters.  Messages are simply
        treated as a block of bytes, with no interpretation
        whatsoever.

        In FidoNet areas, the message body consists of one or more
        paragraphs of text.  Each paragraph is delimited by a hard
        carriage return, '\r', or ASCII 13.  Each paragraph can be of
        any length, so the text should be wordwrapped onto logical
        lines before being displayed.  If created by older
        applications, paragraphs may also contain linefeeds ('\n') and
        soft returns ('\x8d') at the end of each line, but these are
        optional and should always be ignored.

        As an example, assume that the following stream of text was
        returned by MsgReadMsg():

"Hi!\r\rHow's it going?  I got the new MsgAPI kit today!\r\rAnyhow, gotta run!"

        The "\r" marks are carriage returns, so they indicate the end
        of a paragraph.  Notice that the second paragraph is fairly
        long, so it might have to be wordwrapped, depending on the
        screen width.  Your application might wordwrap the text to
        make it look like this, if using a window 40 characters wide:

              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
              ³ Hi!                                   ³
              ³                                       ³
              ³ How's it going?  I got the new MsgAPI ³
              ³ kit today!                            ³
              ³                                       ³
              ³ Anyhow, gotta run!                    ³
              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

        Paragraphs should always be wordwrapped by the application,
        regardless of the screen/window size.  When parsing the
        message text, linefeeds and soft carriage returns should
        be simply skipped.

        The `message control information' has a somewhat more
        restricted format.  The control information is passed to the
        application in the form of an ASCIIZ string.  The control
        information is a variable-length string of text which contains
        information not found in the (fixed-size) message header.

        The format of control information is given by the following
        regular expression:

        (group)+<NUL>

        A `group' consists of a <SOH> and a control item.

        <SOH> is the Start Of Header character, or ASCII 01.  All
        control information strings must begin with an SOH, whether or
        not control items are present.

        Following the <SOH> is a control item.  A control item consists
        of a string which describes the type of control item, or it
        may consist of nothing.

        At least one group must be present in each message.  If a
        message has no extra control information, this field should
        consists of a <SOH> followed by a single <NUL>.

        Although the control items are free-form, the following
        format is suggested:

        <SOH>tag: value

        ...where `tag' is a descriptive identifier, describing the
        type of field that the item represents.  `value' is simply
        free-form text, which continues up until the next SOH or
        <NUL>.

        The character set for the tag and value consists of those
        characters in the range 2-255, inclusive.

        As an example, a message might have the following control
        information:

        <SOH>CHARSET: LATIN1<SOH>REALNAME: Mark Twain<NUL>

        The trailing <NUL> byte must be included in the read count
        given by `cbyt'.

        The return value for this function is the number of bytes read
        from the message body.  If no characters were requested,
        this function returns 0.

        On error, the function returns -1 and sets msgapierr to one of
        the following:

                MERR_BADH
                MERR_BADF
                MERR_NOMEM

sword MsgWriteMsg(MSGH *msgh, word append, XMSG *msg,
                  byte *text, dword textlen, dword totlen,
                  dword clen, byte *ctxt);

        The MsgWriteMsg function is capable of writing the
        message header, body, and control information to
        a message.

        `msgh' is a message handle, as returned by the
        MsgOpenMsg function.  The message must have been
        opened with a mode of MOPEN_CREATE, MOPEN_WRITE
        or MOPEN_RW.

        `append' is a boolean flag, indicating the state of the
        message body.  If `append' is zero, then the API will write
        the message body starting at offset zero.  Otherwise, if
        `append' is non-zero, the API will continue writing from
        the offset used by the last MsgWriteMsg call.  This flag
        applies to the message body only; if no text is to be
        written to the body, this argument should be set to 0.

        `msg' is a pointer to an XMSG structure.  If this pointer
        is non-NULL, then MsgWriteMsg will place the XMSG
        structure information into the message's physical header.
        To leave the header unmodified, NULL should be passed
        for `msg'.  THIS PARAMETER MUST BE PASSED THE **FIRST**
        TIME THAT MSGWRITEMSG() IS USED WITH A JUST-OPENED
        MESSAGE HANDLE!

        `text' points to an array of bytes to be written to the
        message body.  If no text is to be written, this argument
        should be NULL.

        `textlen' indicates the number of bytes to be written
        to the message body in this pass of the MsgWriteMsg
        function.  The text is free-format, and it can consist
        of any characters, including NULs and control
        characters.  If the application does not wish to update
        the message body, a value of 0L should be passed for
        this argument.

        `totlen' indicates the total length of the message to be
        written.  This differs from `textlen' in that the message may
        be written a piece at a time (using small `textlen' values),
        but the total length of the message will not exceed `totlen'.
        This parameter can be somewhat restrictive for the
        application; however, this value is required for optimal use
        of some message base types.  The `totlen' value does not
        have to be the exact length of the message to write; however,
        space may be wasted if this value is not reasonably close
        to the actual length of the message.  The rationale behind
        this argument is that it gives the API writer the most
        flexibility, in terms of supporting future message base
        formats.  If the application can provide this information
        to the API, then almost any message base format can be
        supported by simply dropping in a new API module or DLL.

        To make multiple passes, the FIRST pass should call MsgWriteMsg
        with `append' set to 0, with the total length of the message in
        `totlen', and the length of `text' in textlen.  Second and
        subsequent passes should set `append' to 1, with the length
        of `text' in textlen.

        If the application does not wish to update the message body of
        an existing message, a value of 0L should be passed for this
        argument.

        This argument MUST be specified during the first call to
        the MsgWriteMsg when using a mode of MOPEN_CREATE, even
        if the first call is not requesting any text to be written.
        However, this value will be stored internally, and ignored
        on the second and later calls.

        When operating on a preexisting message (opened with
        MOPEN_WRITE or MOPEN_RW), it is an error to specify a length
        in `totlen' which is greater than the original length of the
        message.

        `clen' specifies the total length of the control information,
        including the trailing NUL byte.  To write no control
        information, a value of 0L should be passed for this
        argument.

        `ctxt' is a pointer to the control information string.  To
        write no control information, a value of 0L should be passed
        for this argument.

        N.B. Several restrictions apply to writing control
        information:

                First and foremost, control information can only be
                written once.  If the control information is to be
                changed, the message must be read and copied to
                another message.

                Secondly, control information MUST be written during
                or before MsgWriteMsg is called with information about
                the message body.

        MsgWriteMsg returns a value of 0 on success, or -1 on error.
        If an error occurred, msgapierr will be set to one of
        the following values:

                MERR_BADH
                MERR_BADF
                MERR_NOMEM
                MERR_NODS

sword MsgKillMsg(MSG *mh, dword msgnum);

        The MsgKillMsg function is used to delete a message from
        the specified message area.

        `mh' is a message area pointer, as returned by MsgOpenArea.

        `msgnum' specifies the message number to kill.

        It is an error to kill a message which is currently open.

        MsgKillMsg returns a value of 0 if the message was successfully
        killed, or it returns -1 on error and sets msgapierr to
        one of the following:

                MERR_BADH
                MERR_NOENT
                MERR_BADF
                MERR_NOMEM

sword MsgLock(MSG *mh);

        The MsgLock function `locks' a message area for exclusive
        access.  This function may enable buffering or otherwise
        improve performance, so it is advised that MsgLock be
        called if speed is a concern when accessing the area.

        All of the MsgAPI functions automatically perform file locking
        and sharing internally, so this function is only required
        when high performance is necessary.

        `mh' is a message area pointer, as returned by the MsgOpenArea
        function.

        MsgLock returns 0 on success.  On error, MsgLock returns
        -1 and sets msgapierr to one of the following:

                MERR_BADH

sword MsgUnlock(MSG *mh);

        The MsgUnlock function unlocks a previously-locked message
        area.

        `mh' is a pointer to a message area, as returned by
        MsgOpenMsg.

        MsgUnlock returns 0 on success, or it returns -1 on error
        and sets msgapierr to:

                MERR_BADH

sword MsgSetCurPos(MSGH *msgh, dword pos);

        The MsgSetCurPos function sets the `current position' in a
        message handle.  This position is used by MsgReadMsg
        to read text from the message body.

        `msgh' is a message handle, as returned by MsgOpenMsg.

        `pos' is the number of bytes into the message from which
        MsgReadMsg should start reading.

        MsgSetCurPos returns 0 on success, or -1 on error and sets
        msgapierr to:

                MERR_BADH

dword MsgGetCurPos(MSGH *msgh);

        The MsgGetCurPos function retrieves the `current position' of a
        message handle.  This position is where the MsgReadMsg
        would read text from the message body next.

        `msgh' is a message handle, as returned by MsgOpenMsg.

        MsgGetCurPos returns the offset into the message on success,
        or (dword)-1 on error and sets msgapierr to:

                MERR_BADH

UMSGID MsgMsgnToUid(MSG *mh, dword msgnum);

        The MsgMsgnToUid function converts a message number to
        a `unique message ID', or UMSGID.  This function can be
        used to maintain pointers to an `absolute' message number,
        regardless of whether or not the area is renumbered or
        packed.  The MsgMsgnToUid function converts a message number
        to a UMSGID, and the MsgUidToMsgn function converts that
        UMSGID back to a message number.

        `mh' is the message area handle, as returned by MsgOpenArea.

        `msgnum' is the message number to convert.

        MsgMsgnToUid returns a UMSGID on success; otherwise, it
        returns 0 and sets msgapierr to:

                MERR_BADH
                MERR_BADF
                MERR_NOENT

        `umsgid' is the UMSGID, as returned by a prior call to
        MsgMsgnToUid.

        `type' is the type of conversion to perform.  `type'
        can be any of the following values:

                UID_EXACT       - Return the message number
                                  represented by the UMSGID, or
                                  0 if the message no longer
                                  exists.

                UID_PREV        - Return the message number
                                  represented by the UMSGID.  If
                                  the message no longer exists,
                                  the number of the preceding
                                  message will be returned.

                UID_NEXT        - Return the message number
                                  represented by the UMSGID.  If

                                  the number of the following
                                  message will be returned.

        If no valid message could be found, MsgUidToMsgn
        returns 0 and sets msgapierr to one of the following:

                MERR_BADH
                MERR_NOENT

dword MsgGetHighWater(MSG *mh);

        The MsgGetHighWater function returns the `high water
        marker' for the current area.  This number represents
        the highest message number that was processed
        by a message export or import utility.

        `mh' is a message area handle, as returned by MsgOpenArea.

        The high water marker is automatically adjusted
        when messages are killed.

        The MsgGetHighWater function returns the high water
        mark number on success, or 0 on error and sets msgapierr
        to:
